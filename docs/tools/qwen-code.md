# Qwen Code

通过 coding-helper enter qwen-code 选择模型并装载。共享事务保存原文件；重复装载不覆盖最初记录，卸载逐字节还原。外部修改会阻止重载和卸载，请先恢复备份再重试。无装载记录时不删除配置。

Use coding-helper enter qwen-code to select and apply a model. Original files are backed up and restored byte-for-byte. External edits block replacement; recover from backup before retrying. No load record means no deletion.

本层不包含 profiles、context 设置或独立模型槽位。 / Profiles, context settings and separate model slots are excluded.

无恢复记录且目标文件仍存在时，卸载会明确报错，配置保持不变。请手动清理旧凭据或恢复已知备份；不会将未修改报告为成功移除。

If a target file exists without a restoration record, unloading fails with recovery guidance and leaves it unchanged. Remove legacy credentials manually or recover a known backup; unchanged files are not reported as successfully cleared.

Unload before changing `QWEN_HOME` (including its value in a user `.env` file). If the selected directory no longer matches an existing restoration transaction, both loading and unloading stop without changing either directory. Restore the previous `QWEN_HOME` setting, unload the recorded configuration, and then select the new directory. A directory alias that resolves to the same files remains supported.
